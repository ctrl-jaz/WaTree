        <h2>About us:</h2>
        <p>
            We make it easier for you to find trees that need water, water them,<br> and leave a positive impact on your enviroment.<br>
            <br>How we started: <br><br>
            Our founder, wanted to help grow and take care of trees. She identifies the main issue<br> is that people, dont know where to start when it comes to taking care of trees. So she created <br>an app to help people keep track and find trees to water and places that need trees to be planted.
